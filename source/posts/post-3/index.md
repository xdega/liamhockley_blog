title: And... we're back!
description: Hey! It has been a while. I finally had a banger of a weekend to rebuild my personal blog. Let's talk about what I have been up to the past couple of years. Spoiler, my day-to-day work no longer revolves around PHP and JS (although, still very loved for my personal projects/tinkers)

# And... we're back!

It's time to update my personal website/blog. While I am at it, why don't I share with you what I have been up to in the past couple of years. What have I been learning? What are my growth plans moving forward?

## What have I been learning the past couple of years?

- Dart/Flutter (enterprise scale)
- Rive (interfacing with the Flutter runtime, learning some basics of how Rive works)
- AI. LLMS. Co-pilot is a core part of my day-to-day work. I think it's important to use it in the appropriate context. (topic for another post)
- This new project has been generated using Static Shock, a Dart-based Static Site Generator. So far, it has been quite rapid and painless to adopt.

## What are my growh plans moving forward?

- Building another project for "tools", where I plan to build out a Python API with FastAPI, and use it as an interface for various LLM, AI related scripts.
- Julia. Eventually want to rewrite my Python API in the "shiny new" Julia language
